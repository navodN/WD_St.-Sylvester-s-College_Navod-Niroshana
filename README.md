## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. It’s about teaching computers to learn, reason, perceive, and understand language, much like humans do.

### A Brief History of AI

- **1950** — The Turing Test: Alan Turing proposes a test for machine intelligence  
- **1956** — Birth of “AI”: The term “Artificial Intelligence” is coined at the Dartmouth Workshop  
- **1997** — Deep Blue vs. Kasparov: IBM’s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov  
- **2011** — Watson Wins Jeopardy!: IBM’s Watson demonstrates strong NLP/knowledge capabilities  
- **2016** — AlphaGo’s Victory: DeepMind’s AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol in Go  
- **2020s** — The Rise of Generative AI: LLMs, diffusion models, etc become widely used

### Core Concepts

- **Supervised Learning** — training on labeled data (e.g. teaching “cat” vs “not cat”)  
- **Unsupervised Learning** — discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning** — agents learn by trial & error with rewards/penalties

## AI in Daily Life

You might be surprised how often you interact with AI. From your morning commute to your evening entertainment, AI is working behind the scenes to make life easier and more efficient.

### Examples

- **Voice Assistants** — using NLP to respond to your voice commands  
- **Recommendation Engines** — suggesting movies, products, etc based on your behavior  
- **Medical Diagnosis** — analyze X-rays, MRIs to assist doctors  
- **Spam Filters** — classify emails as spam or not  
- **Navigation Apps** — optimize routes using real-time traffic data  
- **Facial Recognition** — unlock phones or tag friends in photos

## The Future of AI

### Career Opportunities

The AI boom is creating huge demand. Roles like ML Engineer, Data Scientist, AI Ethicist, Robotics Researcher are on the rise.

### Ethical Considerations

With great power comes great responsibility. Bias, privacy, accountability—these are central challenges for future AI.

### Transforming Industries

From medicine to transportation to art, AI’s reach will expand in ways we can barely imagine now.
